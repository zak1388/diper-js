# Diper-js

This was an idea I had while playing creeper world 3, I was talking with [Artisine](https://github.com/artisine) about how complex the graph traversal in creeper world 3 is, and if it needed to be cached or it was fine anyways


## How to run
- First you'll need to install [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) globally through `npm install -g serve`, or some other web-server.
- Then you can host the src folder, if using serve, run `serve src`
- Open index.html on the web-server you chose
- Have fun: you can select the type of node to place on the right using the html selectors, and then place them using left click, or you can switch to analysis, and find the fastest way to that node from a command node
